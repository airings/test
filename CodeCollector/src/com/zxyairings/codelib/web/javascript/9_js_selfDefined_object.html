			 * js自定义对象。
			 * 
			 * 如果想要自定义对象，应该先对对象进行描述。
			 * js是基于对象，不是面向对象的。不具备描述事物的能力。
			 * 我们还想按照面向对象的思想编写js。
			 * 就要先描述，在js中，可以用函数来模拟面对对象中的描述。
			 * 
			 * js的对象就是键值对，它本质就是一个字典。
			 * Let's go back to the analogy of computer languages being like regular spoken languages. 
			 * In English, you have nouns (which you can think of as "things") and verbs (which you can think of as "actions"). 
			 * Until now, our nouns (data, such as numbers, strings, or variables) and verbs (functions) have been separate.
			 * No longer!
			 * Using objects, we can put our information and the functions that use that information in the same place.
			 * You can also think of objects as combinations of key-value pairs (like arrays), only their keys don't have to be numbers like 0, 1, or 2: they can be strings and variables.
			 * Objects are just collections of information (keys and values) between curly braces, like this:
				 var myObject = {
				     key: value,
				     key: value,
				     key: value
				 };
			 * There are two ways to create an object: 
				 1. using object literal notation
				 	var myObj = {
						    type: 'fancy',
						    disposition: 'sunny'
						};

					var emptyObj = {};
				 2. using the object constructor.
				 	var myObj = new Object();
				 3. You can add keys to your object after you've created it in two ways:
					 myObj["name"] = "Charlie";
					 myObj.name = "Charlie";
			 *
			 * Method
			 * Our setAge method works great for bob because it updates bob.age, but what if we want to use it for other people?
			 * It turns out we can make a method work for many objects using a new keyword, this. 
			 * The keyword this acts as a placeholder, and will refer to whichever object called that method when the method is actually used.
			 * Let's look at the method setAge (line 2) to see how this works. 
			 * By using the keyword this, setAge will change the age property of any object that calls it. 
			 * Previously, we had a specific object bob instead of the keyword this. But that limited the use of the method to just bob.
			 
			 Class:
				 Let's start by introducing classes. We learned in the last course that constructors are a way to make objects, 
				 but they actually do even more than that.
				 When you make a constructor, you are in fact defining a new class. A class can be thought of as a type, 
				 or a category of objects―kind of like how Number and String are types in JavaScript.
			 
				 Classes are very important in object-oriented programming. This is because a class tells us helpful information about objects, 
				 and you can think of an object as a particular instance of a class.
				 
				 Prototype:
					 In general, if you want to add a method to a class such that all members of the class can use it, 
					 we use the following syntax to extend the prototype:
						 className.prototype.newMethod = function() {
							 statements;
						 };
				 Inheritance:
					 Whenever this X is-a Y relationship exists, there's a good chance that we should be using inheritance.
					 Remember, inheritance lets us see and use properties and methods from another class. 
					 To say that Penguin inherits from Animal, we need to set Penguin's prototype to be Animal.
					// set its prototype to be a new instance of Animal, and this is inheritance.
					 Penguin.prototype = new Animal();
				 
				 prototype chain:
					 The "prototype chain" in JavaScript knows this as well. 
					 If JavaScript encounters something it can't find in the current class's methods or properties, 
					 it looks up the prototype chain to see if it's defined in a class that it inherits from. 
					 This keeps going upwards until it stops all the way at the top: the mighty Object.prototype (more on this later). 
					 By default, all classes inherit directly from Object, unless we change the class's prototype, 
					 like we've been doing for Penguin and Emperor.
						// set up the prototype chain
						 Penguin.prototype = new Animal();
						 Emperor.prototype = new Penguin();
				 
				 Public:
					 In JavaScript all properties of an object are automatically public. 
					 Public means that they can be accessed outside the class. 
					 Think of these properties as the information a class is willing to share.
				 Private:
					 The Person class has been modified to have a private variable called bankBalance. 
					 Notice that it looks just like a normal variable, 
					 but it is defined inside the constructor for Person without using this, 
					 but instead using var. This makes bankBalance a private variable.

			1. 将函数作为构造器
			//用js来描述人
			function Person(){//相当于构造器。
//				alert("person run");
			}
			
			2. new 对象
			//通过描述进行对象的建立。 new.
			var p  = new Person();
			// 也可以通过Object这个内置的构造函数来创建对象，这样就不用自己实现构造方法
			var obj = new Ojbect();
			
			3. 动态添加属性，可以使用this关键字
			//动态给p对象添加属性。直接使用p.属性名即可。
			p.name = "zhangsan";
			p.age = 29;
			//如果定义的p对象的属性赋值为一个函数，即是给p对象添加一个方法。
			p.show = function(){
				alert("show :"+this.name+":"+this.age);
			}
			
//			p.show();
			
			
			
			var obj = new Object();
			obj.name = "god father";
			obj.age = 2012;
			
//			alert(obj.name+":"+obj.age);
			*/
			
		
			//4. 将function作为类的定义
			function Person(name,age){
				//在给Person对象添加了两个属性。
				this.name = name;
				this.age = age;
				
				this.setName = function(name){
					this.name = name;
				}
				this.getName = function(){
					return this.name;
				}
			}
			
			
			
			var p = new Person("旺财",20);
			
			// for可以遍历对象的所有属性
			for(x in p){
				println(x+":"+p[x]);//不能使用p.x, p["x"]，因为这表示取对象p的x属性，而我们没有定义x属性
			}
			
			p.setName("小强");
//			alert(p.name);
//			alert(p.getName());

			// 5. 通过字面量来定义类，字面量即dictionary
			//直接使用{}定义属性和值的键值对方式。键值键通过:连接，键与键之间用逗号隔开。 
			var pp  = {
				
				//定义一些成员。
				"name":"小明","age":38,
				"getName":function(){
					return this.name;
				}	
			}
			
			
			// 6. 对象调用成员有两种方式：对象.属性名    对象["属性名"]
//			alert(pp["age"]+":"+pp.name);
			
			
			//用js实现键值对映射关系的集合容器。 
			var oMap = {
				8:"小强",3:"旺财",7:"小明"
			}
			
			
//			var val1 = oMap[8];
//			alert("val1:"+val1);
			
			var val2 = get(7);
//			alert("val2:"+val2);
			
			function get(key){
				return oMap[key];
			}
			
			
			
//			name="lisi";
//			age = 30;
			
			var myobj = {
				myname:"lisisi",myage:30
			}
			
//			alert(myobj.myname+":"+myobj["myage"]);
			
			var myobj2 = {
				"myname2":"hahahah","myage2":48
			}
//			alert(myobj2.myname2+":"+myobj2["myage2"]);
			
			var myMap = {
				
//				names:["lsii1","lisi2","lisi4"],nums:[34,10,48]
				names:[{name1:"zhangsan"},{myname:"hahahah"}]
				
			}
			
//			alert(myMap.names[1]);

//			alert(myMap.names[0].name1);
